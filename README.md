## Synopsis

Palette Picker or PentaChroma is a unique app that allows users to generate 5 color palettes, lock individual colors, create new projects and save palettes.

## Motivation

As an artist myself I wanted to create a useful tool and increase my understanding of svg and polgon elements. I also took
this opportunity to learn how to set up a backend utilizing Express and write the associated tests.
